   <h4>
    he Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford.
     In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate.
      Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate.
       The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty
        coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines,
     initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.

Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. 
Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 
18 months—while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager.
 The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. 
This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.
