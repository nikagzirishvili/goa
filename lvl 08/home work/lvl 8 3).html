    A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end 
    (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) 
    require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.
