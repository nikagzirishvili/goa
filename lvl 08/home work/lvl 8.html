     <h4>
      he Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford.
       In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate.
        Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate.
         The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty
          coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines,
       initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.

  Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. 
  Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 
  18 months—while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager.
   The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. 
  This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.

        Starting in 1969, to aid sales and continue the winning formula of the Mustang, a variety of new performance and decorative options became available,
         including functional air scoops, cable and pin hood tie-downs, and both wing and chin spoilers. Additionally, a variety of performance packages were introduced that included the Mach 1, 
         the Boss 302, and Boss 429. The two Boss models were to homologate the engines for racing. The 1969 Mustang was the last year for the GT option
          (although it did return on the third-generation Mustang for the 1982 model year). A fourth model available only as a hardtop, the Grandé,
          saw success starting in 1969 with its soft ride,
         "luxurious" trim, 55 pounds (25 kg) of extra sound deadening, and simulated wood trim.
